title: Pattern Maturity Scale
info: The component maturity scale is a way to indicate the level of robustness of any component or asset within the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards. Best practices for agile delivery include releasing software incrementally, before itâ€™s perfect. We can (and should) release new items in the Standards following this principle, and we assess each component independently of every other component or the library as a whole.
