Make the best thing the easiest thing.

By offering open-source, quick-to-download code and assets, the Standards make it easy to deliver the highest-quality government websites to the public.

Design for flexibility.

Our patterns and designs are easy to adapt. The Standards encourage consistency over uniformity, which benefits your users and you: The American people feel a sense of familiarity with each site they visit, and you can customize your designs to your agency.

Offer accessibility out of the box.

Every asset we offer meets the high accessibility standards outlined in Section 508. Want to customize the Standards? Not a problem — we also make recommendations for tools you can use to assess your site’s accessibility.

Reuse, reuse, reuse.

No one likes reinventing the wheel. To create the Standards, we reviewed, tested, and repurposed patterns, code, and designs from dozens of government and private-sector style guides. The result? A comprehensive collection of tried-and-true assets that reflect industry best practices.
