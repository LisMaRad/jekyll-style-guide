<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi! </h1>

My name's [Matthew](https://matthewelsom.com), and I built this Jekyll-based tool that you can use to generate and document product or system user interface (UI) patterns in a simple [Living Style Guide](https://livingstyleguide.cc).


## Why?

There are a lot of really great styleguide methods, tools and [examples](http://styleguides.io) out there... but, I struggled to find one that was:

- easy and quick to use,
- simple to maintain,
- a match for my current workflow,
- flexible enough to use on a wide variety of projects.

## Requirements

I decided that the following requirements would meet my needs: 

- Use only [Jekyll](https://jekyll.rb) as a pre-requisit
- Use HMTL/CSS/JS to build a web component, template, etc. (I called these 'patterns')
- Track the 'maturity' of a pattern - i.e. is it ready to use, or not?
- Automatically add all patterns into a 'Roadmap'
- Simple documentation for developers, designers product owners to use
- Build a style guide container or shell that is unobtrusive and easy to visually customize


## Help

- Read the [design principles]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/02-design-principle.html)
- Setup and [installation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started.html) info
- Learn how to [add patterns]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started.html#adding-patterns), and [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/01-getting-started.html#adding-documentation)
- Understand the pattern [maturity]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/03-maturity.html) scale
- View all patterns in the [Roadmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/about/04-roadmap.html)
