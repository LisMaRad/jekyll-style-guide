Organise design styles, create code standards, and maintain a consistent user interface design across your digital product with this boilerplate living style guide.

# Installation

To start youâ€™ll need to download and install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (3.1 or higher) and the boilerplate source code from [Github](https://github.com/matthewelsom/Living_Styleguide). // NEED TO UPDATE WITH CLEAN VERSION



To serve the files locally run the following code in terminal: 

{% highlight terminal %}
$ cd /path/to/local/folder/
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight%}

Once your style guide is complete you can publish it directly to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Install Jekyll, build UI components in HTML with styles and assets attached, add documentation.


- Create your UI components (patterns), or example pages with HTML and store in `src/patterns`.
- Add your pattern/page assets to `src/assets` - CSS architecture follows [this SCSS Playbook](http://matthewelsom.com/blog/simple-scss-playbook.html), but it can be changed to suit your needs.
- Make sure your assets are referenced in the `HEAD` section of the `_layouts/pattern.html` file. 


Patterns and Pages are always loaded in an iframe so Styleguide styles will not interfere with your added assets.

### Design Files

- **src/html/** is used to store your HTML components and example pages. Each `pattern.html` file must start with Front Matter, this applies the `_layouts/pattern.html` template to the file, and rederes it correctly.
- **src/assets/** is used to store any JS, SCSS, CSS, Fonts, etc... that are needed to correctly render your patterns.
- **_docs/** is used to store all pattern documentation is it is important to make sure that every pattern added to the `src/html/` folder has a corresponding file with the same name inside this documentation file.
- **_layouts/pattern.html** is used to generated each pattern and page, ensure your assets are included in the usual HTML way.


# Adding Pages

4. To appear in the sidebar, each pattern/page must have a corresponding `markdown` Documentation file in the `_docs/` folder.
5. The Documentation file should contain the location of the pattern styles, the maturity of the pattern, as well as any further usability information or rules for use.
- All of the style guide pages are kept in the `_docs/` folder.

# Editing the Styleguide

## Includes

- Includes are snippets of code used to help generate the style guide pages. 
- They are stored in the `_includes/` folder.
- You do not need to change these files unless you are changing the function of the style guide shell

& **_layouts/** associated with the styleguide are stored here - they do not need to be edited unless you are changing the function of the styleguide shell.

{% highlight directory %}
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
{% endhighlight %}

---

## _layouts/

- All patterns are generated using the `pattern.html` file. 
- Update this file if you wish to add additonal scripts to your patterns, e.g. If your pattern requires jQuery to run you should add it here. 
- This file contains the `iframeResizer.contentWindow.min.js` script, it is required to make the pattern load correctly in the iFrame. Removing this script will break the style guide.

{% highlight directory %}
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pattern.html
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
{% endhighlight %}

---

## styleguide/

- Contains all of the stylesheets and scripts required to make the styleguide work corretcly. 
- Updating these files will change the appearance and function of the style guide shell.

{% highlight directory %}
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ styleguide/
